# Noor-Portfolio

Hello, I am Noor. Thank you for visiting my website!


I am an economics student interested in economic inequality, labor, and family. 


Presently, I am a student at University College London/Corvinus University of Budapest's MSc program in Economy, State, and Society, housed in the School of Slavonic and East European Studies. My main project at the moment is writing my dissertation on how economic inequalities are influencing families’ labor market interactions, with a focus on family policy, in Hungary.


Before beginning this program, I lectured in the American University of Armenia’s Gender Studies minor, teaching a course called Gender Perspectives. This class was an introduction to gender studies and feminism, and covered political and economic case studies from the region.


While in Armenia, I conducted a project on how social media communities are being used as a facilitation tool for the formation of in-person communities by queer youth in Yerevan. The resulting paper will be published in 2026.


My previous degrees are from The New School in New York. I completed my BA in Global Studies and Economics and MA in Economics there. While at The New School, I focused on feminist economics and transition economies. I am interested in how empires influence gender relations and women’s rights. 


My broad research interests are on gender and social reproduction through a lens of labor markets and economic inequality. I am also interested in feminist and queer political economy more broadly, and small-scale economic development.


I have worked as an Armenian-English translator since 2018. 


My spare time is spent in the mountains or with a book. In the navigation tab of this website, you will find some lists of feminist and queer book recommendations, both fiction and nonfiction.
