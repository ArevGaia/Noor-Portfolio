            <h3> I am an incoming student to University College London/Corvinus University of Budapest's International Masters in Economy, State, and Society (Politics and the International Economy track), housed in the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, where I will focus on regional family policy.
            </h3>
            <h3> Previously, I have lectured at the American University of Armenia's gender studies minor, teaching a course called Gender Perspectives which surveyed gender studies and covered political and economic case studies from the region.
            </h3>
            <h3> I am interested in how gender and social reproduction impact economic empires, as well as feminist political economy more broadly. I am an experienced researcher and skilled communicator, with a background in policy debate.

            <h3>
            My prior studies were at The New School for Social Research.
